            <p>This blog recommends places to eat near the UNCG campus. None of these resturants take Flex, but they are all within walking distance of the Petty building. There are options for healthy foods, gluten free, or just yummy burritos! If you're looking to use Flex, there are plenty of places on campus that will accept it.</p>
